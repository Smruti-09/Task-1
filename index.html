        In a quiet town nestled between sprawling green hills and dense forests,there lived a pecuilar man named Elwood.
        He was not pecuilar in the sense that he behaved oddly or dressed strangely,but rather,because he possessed
        an extraordinary gift - Elwood could hear the whispers of the wind.Most townsfolk thought Elwood was just a dreamer,
        often seen wandering the woods or standing still in open meadows with his head titled as if listening to an unseen speaker.
        But Elwood had always known his gift was real.Since childhood,the wind had spoken to him, carrying secrets from distant lands
        and stories of forgotten times.One autum evening, as the crimson sun dipped below the horizon,Elwood stood on the edge of
        the forest,captivated by the murmurs of a brisk northen brezze.But this time,the wind's whisper carried urgency."Elwood"it said,
        its voice like the rustling of dry leaves,"a great danger approaches.The forest will fall silent if nothing is done".
        Elwood's heart quickend.The forests was his sanctury,a place alive with birdsong, the rustle of squirrels,and the soothing hum of 
        ancient trees.He could not bear the thought of it falling silent."What must I do ?" he asked aloud, his voice trembelling.
